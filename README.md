# hestertzehun-project-1-
Welcome to the first project for SWEN20003! Across Project 1 and 2, you will design and create a simulation of a fictional universe. In this project, you will create the basis of a larger simulation that you will complete in Project 2.

Use Object Oriented Programming principles to create a simulation of a pixelated 2D universe with trees, gatherers that move and a grass background.
